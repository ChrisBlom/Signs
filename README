What is Abstract Categorial Grammar?

Abstract Categorial Grammar (ACG) is a formal framework to define languages and relations between languages.

ACG defines languages by a set of typed lambda terms, and relations between languages as
mappings between such terms. This provides a very nice way of describing relations between syntax and semantics 
in languages.

What is SIGNS?

Basically, a REPL for ACG signs.
